# JavaScript II

## Topics

* recursion - when it function calls itself until it doesn't
* base case - 
* constructors
* `new`
* `prototype`
* `.bind`, `.call`, `.apply`
* `this`
* `class`
* methods
* inheritance
* prototype methods vs methods in the constructor (Methods that inherit via the prototype chain can be changed universally for all instances)
* class vs instance


## Instructions

* Fork and clone this repo.
* Run the command `npm i` to install needed node packages.
* Run the command `npm test <filename>` to run the tests. (Example: `npm test prototype`)
* Work through the files and make the tests pass.
* Suggested order: `prototype.js`, `class.js`, `recursion.js`, `this.js`.
* When you are finished submit a pull request.
* Make commits often.  A good practice would be to make a commit when you get a test, or set of tests, to pass.
