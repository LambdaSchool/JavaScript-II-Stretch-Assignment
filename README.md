# JavaScript II

## Topics

* recursion - when it function calls itself until it doesn't
* base case - a "stopper" solution that has a known solution that returns out of the function.
* constructors - functions that create objects of the same type with set variables.
* `new`- keyword used to create an instance of an object
* `prototype` - All objects inherit properties and methods from the prototype that it sits upon.
* `.bind` - returns a copy of the function and forces the function to reference the object where it's bound to.
*`.call` - allows you to call a function by an ojbect outside of another object passing the other object as an arugment
*`.apply`
* `this` - refers to the context where the function is being call and refers to that object
* `class` - 
* methods
* inheritance
* prototype methods vs methods in the constructor (Methods that inherit via the prototype chain can be changed universally for all instances)
* class vs instance


## Instructions

* Fork and clone this repo.
* Run the command `npm i` to install needed node packages.
* Run the command `npm test <filename>` to run the tests. (Example: `npm test prototype`)
* Work through the files and make the tests pass.
* Suggested order: `prototype.js`, `class.js`, `recursion.js`, `this.js`.
* When you are finished submit a pull request.
* Make commits often.  A good practice would be to make a commit when you get a test, or set of tests, to pass.
